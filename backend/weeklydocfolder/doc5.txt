Restaurant Review: The vadapav scene in bambai (Mumbai) is legendary. Near the famous Siddhivinayak temple, there's a fantastic shop serving piping hot batata vadas. Interestingly, the nearby Starbuck's has started serving vada pav inspired sandwiches!
Another must-visit spot is the iconic Anand Stall, known for its delicious and spicy vada pav. The chutneys they serve are a perfect blend of tangy and spicy, making every bite a burst of flavors. Locals and tourists alike flock to this stall, especially during the evening rush hours.

For a more modern twist, head over to Shivaji Park where you'll find a fusion vada pav joint. They offer a variety of fillings, from cheese to schezwan, catering to the adventurous palate. This place has become a favorite among the younger crowd, adding a contemporary touch to the traditional snack.
