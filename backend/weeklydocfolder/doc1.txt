My recent trip to New-Delhi was amazing! The street food scene in dilli is unmatched. Had some incredible chole bhature from a small shop near Connaught Place. Later that evening, we visited the local McD's (that's what locals call McDonald's here) for a quick burger.
we had a great time there wow i love to eat food there no other waay to love but eat eat eat
