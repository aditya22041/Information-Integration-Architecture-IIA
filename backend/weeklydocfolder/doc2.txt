4. **Coupes**: These are two-door cars with a sporty appearance. They are designed for performance and style, often preferred by younger drivers.

5. **Convertibles**: These cars have a roof that can be retracted or removed, allowing for an open-air driving experience. They are popular in regions with warm climates.

6. **Electric Cars**: With the rise of environmental concerns, electric cars have gained popularity. They run on electricity instead of gasoline, reducing carbon emissions and fuel costs.

7. **Hybrid Cars**: These cars use a combination of gasoline and electric power to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
