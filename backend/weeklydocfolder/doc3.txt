Food Blog: The best butterchicken I've ever had was at a small restaurant in hydrabad. The way they prepare their murg makhani is simply outstanding. Speaking of Hyderabad, the local TimHortons has surprisingly good coffee!
Another delightful dish to try in Hyderabad is the biryani. The blend of spices and the tender meat make it a must-try for any food lover. Each bite is a burst of flavor that leaves you wanting more. Don't miss out on this culinary gem when you visit the city!
